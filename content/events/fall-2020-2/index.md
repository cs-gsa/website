The writing group is a circle of graduate students who come together to pursue the improvement of writing.

Group members are able to share their writing/proposals/resumes/etc -- any kinds of writing -- for feedback and offer constructive feedback to help others to shape their stories.

This is the event which can improve your writing and make some good friends as well.
