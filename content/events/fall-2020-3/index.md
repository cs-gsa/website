Hello everyone,

Hope your semester is going well.

As an excuse for having a little break from the hectic schedules, relax, talk to people and have fun, we are having a (long overdue) game night today.

We will be hanging out on zoom and playing [Among Us](http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php), an EPIC online and local party game of MYSTERY and INTRIGUE, of TEAMWORK and BETRAYAL, of ACTION and SUSPENSE...in space!

Ages 5+, so you are all old enough to join.

The hangout part is also important for the format of the game itself. So don't be shy, come and join us for some silly fun! üéÆ

In addition to all the fun, participants get a Domino's Pizza discount coupon. THAT'S RIGHT üçï coupons for all attendees!

App:
  1. Android - Free on Google Play store.
  2. iOS - Free on the App Store.
  3. Windows desktop - Can buy it for a onetime price of $5.00.
  Links to each can be found here <http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php>.

We will be playing a number of rounds, with possibly several games simultaneously if enough people come

So you can join/drop out anytime b/w 7:00pm - 9:30pm
