Hey everyone!

To help get us all outside a bit more (while it’s still slightly warm) the CSGSA is putting on a VIRTUAL SCAVENGER HUNT!

Below is a list of 20+ buildings/objects/landmarks that participants should find and take selfies in front of.

Notice, these are not specific places, just ‘types’ so everyone should be able to participate, regardless of whether they have a vehicle.

You should also track the location of each photo so you can tell everyone where you found everything!

This activity should help new students to get familiar with their neighborhoods as well as others around the Twin Cities.

When you have taken all of your photos, send them and their locations (txt file) in a zip folder to the CSGSA email account (cs-gsa@umn.edu).

The event runs until November 23rd. All photos should be ‘selfies’, i.e., they must contain the participant.
