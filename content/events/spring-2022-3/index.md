Details: CSGSA organized a group to attend the Minneapolis Earth Day Clean-Up event at East River Flats Park (the riverfront park just below the U). Bags and gloves were provided by the city. CSGSA provided a lunch for our members in attendance. We spent about 2 hours (9:30 am  - 12 pm) cleaning up the park by picking up trash and recycling.
