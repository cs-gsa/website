## Ethan Kulman, President
PhD student studying Computational Genomics.

<kulma009@umn.edu>

{{ image(image="ethan.png") }}

Ethan is a 2nd year PhD student studying Computational Genomics under the supervision of Dr. Rui Kuang. He is particularly interested in modeling the biological mechanisms of cancer, i.e., what causes cancer initiation, metastasis, relapse, etc. Ethan wants to help foster a fun, inclusive environment for graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). He’s very open to ideas about how to go about doing this, and encourages any student in CSE to share their thoughts and experiences with the CSGSA leadership team. Ethan’s biggest hobby is hiking, and is currently working on hiking the highest peak in all 50 U.S. states. When he’s not doing some outdoor activity, you’ll find him trying new restaurants in the Twin Cities, at the university gym or nearby rock climbing gym, or taking care of his new Golden Retriever puppy.

Hi, my name is Risako and I’m a 4th-year PhD student working in NLP and affective computing. I enjoy going to the gym, self-learning on YouTube, and reading (mostly Japanese fiction and English nonfiction). Due to the pandemic, I’ve also started growing some plants; I have a pet lemon tree that has only given me one-inch lemons so far and some rice stalks growing in a bowl (my ancestors would be so proud). I graduated from Carleton College, which is about an hour south of here, and worked in the Bay Area as a software engineer before coming back to Minnesota for grad school.
