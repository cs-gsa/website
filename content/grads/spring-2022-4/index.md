# Abstract
In physical and earth sciences, several processes can be characterized by multi-scale and multi-level physics. They are formulated as strongly-coupled differential equations and simulating them as such, can be computationally challenging. Even in absence of physical equations, building multiple models to separately model the different levels of information leads to increased resource cost. Using a multi-resolution Gaussian processes model, we can accurately forecast the multi-scale physics in a dynamical, chaotic system. We will look at an atmospheric modeling case study to demonstrate this.
