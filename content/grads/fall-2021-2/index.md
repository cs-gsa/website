# Abstract
Internet of things (IoT) devices has been ubiquitous in recent years. However, a large number of devices, heterogeneous networks, and varieties of applications make IoT ecosystems complex and vulnerable. An edge-based system called Constellation is proposed to provide a unified view to manage and coordinate the tasks of IoT devices. However, this infrastructure is exposed to many threats and attacks.  In this project, the privacy and security requirements of Constellation are addressed. A variety of existing solutions are studied and compared based on different trust models. We adopt a technique known as privacy mediators that use the Federated Byzantine Agreement. This privacy mediator provides open membership, distributed trust, and high scalability. Moreover, it can provide constant real-time response and security guarantees.Internet of things (IoT) devices has been ubiquitous in recent years.
