# Who we are?
- The Computer Science Graduate Students Association (CSGSA) is the official student governance organization for graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and a registered Campus Life Program.
- Every student in the department is automatically a member of CSGSA.
- Officers are elected annually, and are in charge of fulfilling CSGSAâ€™s goals in the most fun way possible!
- Find information about current officers @ [people](/people).
- If you're interested in becoming an officer go to [get-involved](/get-involved) page.
- For complete details, check out [the CSGSA constitution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/112aBo3FLgu9qcMN4709y0z4Kqr5LzhKe/view?usp=sharing) and our annual [calendar of events](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LhfdExLNji5KUSDef3rLYIWhiCw_jVjo/view?usp=sharing).
