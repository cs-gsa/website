# Who we are?
- The Computer Science Graduate Students Association (CSGSA) is the official student governance organization for graduate students in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, and a registered Campus Life Program.
- Every student in the department is automatically a member of CSGSA.
- Officers are elected annually, and are in charge of fulfilling CSGSAâ€™s goals in the most fun way possible!
- Find information about current officers @ [people](/people).
