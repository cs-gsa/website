## John Harwell, President
5th Year PhD working in artificial intelligence and robotics.

<harwe006@umn.edu>

{{ image(image="john.jpg") }}

My name is John Harwell (though I usually go by John The Conquerer, Destroyer of Realms, Slayer of Beasts, Proponent of Finger Painting), and I'm one of the candidates for president. I'm 5 years young into my PhD program working in Artificial Intelligence and robotics. When I am taking a break from PhD purgatory, I enjoy the following (in no particular order): Singing sea shanties with my fellow salty seadogs, purveying the latest in viking beard fashion, brewing and fermenting of all things alcoholic in search of the fabled ULTIMATE BREW, blacksmithing my own iron-age eating utensils and battle axes, playing my guitars, watching bugs getting zapped on a buglight on warm summer evenings, training to SLAY the three-headed IRON HYDRA of swimming, cycling and running, luxuriating while being barefoot on warm (not hot!) coals, honing the razor's edge of my meme and gif game, organizing my clothes in a FIFO queue. If thou has questions for me about the BAND of BROTHERS and SISTERS which I wish to form to dance and revel upon the platform held built atop our collective FEARS and DOUBTS while we slowly crush and erase them from our lives, please message me.

## Risako Owan, Treasurer

Hi, my name is Risako and I’m a 2nd-year PhD student working in NLP and affective computing. I enjoy going to the gym, self-learning on YouTube, and reading (mostly Japanese fiction and English nonfiction). Due to the pandemic, I’ve also started growing some plants; I have a pet lemon tree that has only given me one-inch lemons so far and some rice stalks growing in a bowl (my ancestors would be so proud). I graduated from Carleton College, which is about an hour south of here, and worked in the Bay Area as a software engineer before coming back to Minnesota for grad school.
