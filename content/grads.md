# What is it?
- The Graduate Research and Discussion Seminars (GRaDS) are student-organized lunch talks open to CS graduate students in any area.
- Students speak at GRaDS to practice for conference or job talks, inform their fellow students on their research, or simply build their presentation skills.
- As a more informal venue than most, GRaDS is a great resource for students to practice important talks and get feedback from their peers.
- It also allows the graduate student body to remain informed about the research going on in other labs at UMN.
- GRaDS is held biweekly on Fridays, announced on the [cscigrads@umn.edu](mailto:cscigrads@umn.edu) email list.
- Students (used to, before COVID-19) gather in Keller Hall 2-212 for a catered lunch and an hour of presentation.
